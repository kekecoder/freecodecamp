<h1><strong>Survey Form </strong></h1>
Survey Form page has been created, i can say for sure am learning as fast as i could and i know within me that from here onward i can only get better, hopefully i will continue to learn more along side, am also learning how to use <b>GITHUB</b> along side learning coding on Freecodecamp, it has been amazing journey.<br>
Up next i will be working on the css to make it more insteresting for now, is just the html page that's up and running. You can check it out :love_letter: from ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬

Have added the css to style the survey form, thou yet to be completed, once it's done, i will update this page, as it is, i have been able to understand little of how css work and why it is very important. Hopefully i can be able to complete it as soon as possible so that i can move on to the next project. Thanks!!!
